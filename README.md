# Ms_Paint
It's a simple recreation of ms_paint where we can draw iamges. I am tracing the courser position on the screen and pushing that to the array. Function is envoked on various mouse events which trace the mouse postion and push taht to the array and after that line is drawn on the screen via iterating through the array.

Interface is made using simple html and Css, and there is also an option to download the file in png format too.
